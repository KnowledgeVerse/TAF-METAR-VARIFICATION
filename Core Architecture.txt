Core Architecture

1. Modular Design
Utils: Time calculations, category determination, weather decoding
Parser: TAF and METAR parsing with validation
VerificationEngine: Core verification logic with all required functions
UI: Dashboard rendering and chart management
State: Global state management


2. Valid TAF Selection (selectValidTAF)
Filters TAFs by station and validity period
Handles month-boundary crossings
Selects latest issued TAF (supersedes earlier ones)
Returns OUT_OF_VALIDITY if no valid TAF found


3. Active Time Group Detection (detectActiveTimeGroup)
Priority: FM > TEMPO > BECMG > PROB
Handles overlapping windows correctly
Returns group type, transition status, and TEMPO weights


4. BECMG Logic (detectActiveTimeGroup)
Detects transition windows
Allows both old/new conditions during transition (+15% score boost)
Applies only new conditions after transition


5. TEMPO Logic (compareWeather)
Applies 60% weight for normal TEMPO
Applies 80% weight for severe weather TEMPO (TS, SHRA, +)
Partial credit system


6. ICAO Tolerance Rules
Wind: ±30° direction, ±5kt speed, ±7kt gust
Visibility: ≥5000m → ±2000m, <5000m → ±1000m
Cloud: Low ceiling ±200ft, normal ±500ft


7. Flight Category Logic
Converts to VFR/MVFR/IFR/LIFR
OPERATIONALLY_CORRECT status when category matches but exact values don't


8. Lead Time Analysis
Calculates hours between TAF issue and METAR
Buckets: 0-6, 6-12, 12-18, 18-24, 24-30 hours
Tracks accuracy by lead time


9. Weighted Scoring
Wind: 20, Visibility: 25, Cloud: 25, Weather: 20, Category: 10
Ratings: Excellent (90-100), Good (75-89), Moderate (50-74), Poor (<50)


10. Anomaly Detection
Format validation
Station/date mismatch
Wind direction/speed inconsistencies
TS without CB
Low visibility without weather


11. Trend Analysis
Improvement/degradation detection
Consistency scoring
Consecutive failure tracking
Professional UI Features



Executive Summary: KPI cards with color-coded scores
Interactive Charts: Wind timeline, visibility categories, ceiling distribution, lead time analysis, skill radar, parameter trends
Detailed Table: Sortable, filterable verification log
Anomaly Panel: Visual anomaly reporting
Export: JSON and CSV export functionality
Responsive Design: Works on all screen sizes
Glassmorphism: Modern aviation-grade aesthetic
The system is fully self-contained in a single HTML file with no external dependencies except Chart.js and Font Awesome. It's ready to use immediately and scales efficiently for large datasets.
